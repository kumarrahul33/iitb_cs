# Problems 
there might be some problem with the < operator defined in the starter code.

# Progress
1. implemented find function
    - added a getJourneyCode function in the TreeNode Struct definition

2. implemented insert *without considering the imbalance*


# Next Steps
    - make a function to rotate the tree as required line 284 in the function correctImbalance.
    - just check which condition the situation falls in and then call the appropriate rotate function.
    - complete the BST.cpp
    - implement delete
Thats it we are done
