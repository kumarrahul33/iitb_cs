I AM REALLY SORRY I COULD NOT FIX SOME BUGS.. FLTK WAS A VERY NEW LIBRARY FOR ME AND DEBUGGING WAS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY AND THE 
DEADLINE WAS APPROACHING.

HOW TO PLAY:
    1.YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON THE BATSMAN WITH PERFECT TIMING TO HIT A SHOT
    2.THE BLOCKS ON THE RIGHT SHOW THE MINIMUM HEIGHT TO GET THE RESPECTIVE RUN; CROSSING THE HIGHEST MEANS SIX AND THE LOWEST 
      CORRESPONDS TO 1 RUN.
Design:
    Classes used:
        MyRectangle
            used to make the wickets and the "run demarcating" blocks.
        
        Ball
            #used to make the ball. 

            #All the core functionality of the game is handled in the ball as it is the most complex of all the objects and motion 
             and logic both are involved in it.
            
            #movement of the ball:
                ->ball is moved by utilizing the function of the fltk called add_timeout.

                ->I first created a ball objects and then after a certain amount of time i call a functon(timeractions) to 
                    1.delete the ball widget and 
                    2.create a new ball widget corresponding to the next frame and also 
                    3.cleanly wiping the impressions of the deleted ball.
                    
                ->this way the we don't pile the memory with the undeleted ball widgets and also the ball keeps moving.

            #ball logic:
                all the logic are mainly handled in the gameplay function of the ball class which gets called after every frame.
                logic involves bouncing of ball, throwing of the new ball when required,getting out etc.

            #also used in updating scores

        Batsman:
            #it is used in making the batsman.
            #it also recieves the click from the user and if the timing is correct the ball is hit.
                ->this has been achieved by the use of a global variable hitit.
