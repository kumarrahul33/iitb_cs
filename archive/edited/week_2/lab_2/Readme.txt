Fan
	we can adjust the knob of the fan even when it is off but the speed of the fan is undefined since it is off.

roomscheduler
    this program accepts the booking for 6 days only and there are 6 rooms available for each day
    while booking a room we need to give only the day and the program will allot the room automatically
    for cancelling a booked room we need to provide the day and the room number of the booking
    day and room takes value from 0 to 5

Lift
    The main assumption is that we first need to bring the Lift to the current floor then set the destination floor.

tupleSpace
    the key is integer and the value is a string
    to find an element we need to give the value of that element
    to delete an element we need to give the key of that element

Vending 
    we need to pass two values in the giveDrink function first is the drink number and the second is the coin(true or false).
    assumption is that one coin will buy us one drink and the value true or false will tell the person has put coin in or not.


Approach for solving these problems:
    1. Imagine the real-life counterparts of these programs and make the programs as close as possible to them.
    2. All the functionality are provided by the public fucntions which are appropriately named.
    3. The internal working and the variables are kept hidden from the user.
    4. No global variables are used.
