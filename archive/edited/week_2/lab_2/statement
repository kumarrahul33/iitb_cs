Design the following object abstractions as classes.
The object is to be used by instantiating its class in main().

The functions that you call on the objects go into public section
of the class.

The functions use common set of variables which form the object's
state, which is private in the class.


Stick to filenames as given below.


List of Abstractions and filenames:

1. Fan (as discussed in the class): 

     fan.cpp

2. ATM (as discussed in the class): 


     atm.cpp

3. DrinksVendingMachine (takes in a coin and choice of drink, and
   provides the drink if available. Someone can replenish the stocks
  of drinks as well:  


      vending.cpp

4. Dice (toss to generates a number on top): 

      dice.cpp

5. TupleSpace(A collection of key-value pairs: functions to insert
  delete and find elements in it): 

      tuplespace.cpp

6. Lift (it has internal and external buttons (interfaces). you can merge them
into one single public section.  For
simplicity, you can assume that there are
     only two floors) 

     lift.cpp

7. RoomScheduler (rooms in the department, request for bookings, 
   cancell bookings, schedule for one week, state you assumptions)

    roomscheduler.cpp
