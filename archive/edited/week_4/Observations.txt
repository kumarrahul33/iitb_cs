to draw the circle design :
    1. The Circle Design is made by first inheriting the Fl_widget then redefing the draw function to our convinience. This is done so that 
       our class has the full access to the Fl_widget public functions and therefore act as a upgraded widget.
    2. I made a polar to cartesian coordinate system converter using the class called "Coordinates".
    3. It has also the capability of shifting the orign and converting the with respect to that orign. When new orign is not given 
       then the Coordinates object is initiallised with the default orign.
    4. The CircleDesign class is made such that it is movable, means we can shift the design to appropriate location.
    5. We also had to make a suitable constructor for this class.

Triangular tiles
    1. with similar approach as the circle design i made triangular designs and assigned random color to them.
    2. then i inheried the tridesign class to tridesignInv class which is used to make inverted triangular designs because these classes
       were very similar.
    3. i then put the triangles and the circle design in place and the rangoli was ready.
