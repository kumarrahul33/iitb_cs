all the verbs subjects and objects are first loaded in their respective list and
then we generate sentences by the following way:
	a recursive call is made in which all the sentences corresponding to the 
	an objects are printed and then the function call is made by passing the 
	object list with the used object removed.
	this way all the combination of the objects, subjects and verbs are used 
	to make sentences.
