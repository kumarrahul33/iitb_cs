Problem1
    1. To solve the problem i made the superclass with feature 1
	The reason is that feature 1 is common to all the products and since 
	we are using inheritance we can inherit this feature to other products
	without copying of code.

    2. Then used inheritance to add the respective features required to make productB and productA.

    3. this was the easiest way to solve the problem.

Problem2
    1. I made the classes of the individual features and then combined them to make the final products. This is because 
       there was no straight-forward choice for a suberclass from which we can start the hierarchy.
    
    2. Though i used inheritance to make the TV_1_1 form the TV1 class since they shared some features;

Problem3
    1. i made the classes of the individual features and then combined them to make the assemblies for products. I then combined those
       to make the final products.

    2. In this problem i used the fact that the acer aspire product line was very similar.
       I made an assembly for the acer aspire series and by just changing the display and the ram 
       i made different acer aspire products.

    3. The products that were very differnt from the rest like Acer Aspire 3 , was built from scrach 
        using the feature classes.

Problem4
    1. i made the classes of the individual features and then combined them to make the assemblies for products. I then combined those
       to make the final products.
    
    2. in the iPhone 12 and mini i used the intermediate assembly iPhone12_assembly. This way the work was reduced and i just had to change the 
       display and the product was ready.
    
    3. On the other hand iPhone11 and iPhoneXR had not much in common among themselves or others so making them form scrach was a better idea.
