atoms.cpp
    1. the original code was very badly intended. It was very difficult to understand the code and the control flow was not clear.
    2. all the code was dumped into a single fucntion called f making it even difficult to see how to code was working.
    3. there was also the use of an unnecessary global variable call m.

    Changes Made:
    1. I intended the code appropiatlely to see whats going on with the program.
    2. I eliminated the unnecessary global variable.
    3. when use of parts of code became clear i separated the code doing a particular function into different function.
        i made three functions 
        1. readData, this function handled reading of the data from the given file and putting it into the variable provided.
        2. angleElec, this function gave the value of angle between the eletron to the main drawing function.
        3. boxMaker, this is used by the main funtion to make lines(orbits).
        4. drawAtom, this is the main drawing function of the program.

alchemy.cpp
    1. all the code except the classes, structs, and a few other functions was put into the main making it difficult to understand the code.
    2. important and garbage variables all were put in the same place in the main making the code even more unreadable.

    Changes made:
    1. I first broke the code with respect to functionality and encapsulated the each functionality into either a class or a fucntion whichever appropriate.
    2. UserMgmt:
       I made a class called UserMgmt which deals with all the things related to a user, such as validation of a user or adding a new user 
       and related things. I made a class because user management is a big task and multiple functions are involved in it. So it would be better to encapsulate
       the functions of UserMgmt further into functions called addNewUser and validateUser but making them private so that they don't get accidently called.
       the function getUser returns the name of the user playing and is a public function.
    3. getThings:
       thing was an important array in the program and populating the array with information was an big task. So i encapsulated this functionality into the function
       called getThings.
    4. startGame:
        this is the function which encapsulate how the game will proceed.
