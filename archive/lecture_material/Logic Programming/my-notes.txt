* Facts:

father(he,dodo).
father(dick,jojo).
mother(mary,dodo).
mother(tery,jojo).
likes(john,mary).
likes(mary,cherry).
likes(john,food).
likes(mary,food).
likes(don,movies).

* Goals:

?- likes(mary,X)

	prolog will provide one solution for X,
	and ask whether you want all solutions, or you want to step through other solns

* Conjunctions in Goals:

?- likes(john,X),likes(mary,X)

Variables: X was a variable
	- use a variable when you can't name an object
	- any name beginning with capital letter is a variable


* Rules

likes(john,X):-likes(X,movies).

the rule is:  john likes X if X likes movies


married(X,Y):-mother(X,K),father(Y,K).
married(X,Y):-married(Y,X).  <--- this causes recursion if you want all solutions!


married(X,Y):-mother(X,K),father(Y,K).
married(X,Y):-mother(Y,K),father(X,K). <--- this captures symmetric relation, but contradicts
			with above rule, same with or conjunction 


married(X,Y):-mother(X,K),father(Y,K);mother(Y,K),father(Y,K).

Ored conjuncts are independent rules.
