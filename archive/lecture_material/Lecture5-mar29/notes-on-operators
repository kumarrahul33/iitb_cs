operators
	are functions
		x * x
		is the same as add (x,x)

	convenient way to express ideas as mathematical operations			
	they can be 
		unary  -- one operator  !
		binary -- take two operands + - / *   []

	several standard operators already in the language
		mathematical  - + * / ...
		logical    &&, ||, ...,&, |
		array indexing  []
		input output  <<  >> 
		comparison  ==
	
 	many of which can be overloaded -- means we can give a new
		meaning to them on new types of operands not known
		to the language!!

	
	operators have precedence rules

		c + a * b
