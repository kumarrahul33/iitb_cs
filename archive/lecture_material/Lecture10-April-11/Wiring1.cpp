// a class, a main, main creates an object at runtime, a statically created object

// that local state is initialized in the constructor 
// the destructor gets called when object is destroyed 
// explicitly created objects (using new) are to be explicitely deleted 
// if you don't it creates garbage -- things that are never going to be used 
// statically created objects are automatically deleted
